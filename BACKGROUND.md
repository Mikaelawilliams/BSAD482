# Enhancing Nova Scotia's Tourism Sector through Community Engagement 
*A Decision Intelligence Approach to Analyzing Nova Scotia’s Tourism Industry*  

## Problem Context 
Nova Scotia's tourism industry is a key component of the province's economy. It’s celebrated for its rich cultural heritage, scenic landscapes, and historical landmarks. Between January and September 2024, the province saw approximately 1.6 million tourists. This represented a small 2% decline from the same timeframe in 2023 and a 13% drop compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019 [[1]](#1). This decline shows the need for strategic initiatives to revitalize the sector. 

Engaging local communities is a key approach to encouraging tourism growth. When residents actively participate, they contribute to authentic visitor experiences, help preserve cultural heritage and support sustainable tourism initiatives. The Department of Communities, Culture, Tourism, and Heritage (CCTH) plays a vital role in this process by collaborating with agencies, boards, and commissions that work to enhance Nova Scotia’s cultural and tourism landscape [[2]](#2). 

## Significance of the Study 
This analysis is timely and crucial for several reasons: 

1. In 2019, tourism in Nova Scotia brought in $2.6 billion which shows its significance to the local economy [[3]](#3). 

2. Unama'ki (Cape Breton Island) is about 13.6% of the province's population, but with its community centered approach it contributes 17% to 19% of the province’s tourism revenue, GDP, taxes, and jobs [[4]](#4). 

3. Globally, community-based tourism was worth $575.9 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow to $2,136.8 billion by 2032, increasing by 14.1% each year [[5]](#5). 

4. Involving local communities in tourism helps protect and promote their culture. For example, community-based tourism often includes local people in planning and running tourism activities which offers visitors real cultural experiences while also preserving traditions [[6]](#6). 

## Research Objectives 
This study aims to: 
1. Evaluate the current level of community engagement in Nova Scotia's tourism sector. 
2. Determine challenges faced by communities in participating in tourism initiatives and identify potential opportunities for increased involvement. 
3. Propose strategies to enhance community engagement by leveraging existing structures within the CCTH.
