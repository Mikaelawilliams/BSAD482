# Enhancing Nova Scotia's Tourism Sector by Leveraging Domestic Travel
*A Decision Intelligence Approach to Analyzing Nova Scotia’s Tourism Industry*  

## Problem Context 
Nova Scotia's tourism industry is a key component of the province's economy. It’s celebrated for its rich cultural heritage, scenic landscapes, and historical landmarks. Between January and September 2024, the province saw approximately 1.6 million tourists. This represented a small 2% decline from the same timeframe in 2023 and a 13% drop compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019 [[1]](#1). This decline shows the need for strategic initiatives to revitalize the sector. 

Leveraging domestic travel is a key approach to encouraging tourism growth given the current political climate. By analyzing travel trends among Nova Scotians, domestic visitor volumes, accommodation demand, and resident perceptions, this study aims to identify actionable strategies to strengthen internal tourism. The findings will help tourism stakeholders refine marketing campaigns, enhance visitor experiences, and support sustainable growth in the industry.

## Significance of the Study 
This analysis is timely and crucial for several reasons: 

1. In 2019, tourism in Nova Scotia brought in $2.6 billion which shows its significance to the local economy [[2]](#2). 

2. Unama'ki (Cape Breton Island) is about 13.6% of the province's population, but with its community centered approach it contributes 17% to 19% of the province’s tourism revenue, GDP, taxes, and jobs [[3]](#3). 

3. Domestic tourism is a vital pillar of the industry, especially in times of global economic uncertainty. Understanding travel patterns within Nova Scotia and Canada can help maximize the economic impact of internal tourism. 

## Research Objectives 
This study aims to: 
1. Evaluate the current level of community engagement in Nova Scotia's tourism sector. 
2. Determine challenges faced by communities in participating in tourism initiatives and identify potential opportunities for increased involvement. 
3. Propose strategies to enhance community engagement by leveraging existing structures within the CCTH.
